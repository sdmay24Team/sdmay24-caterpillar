Repository for the Unified Caterpillar Tracker.

The purpose of this project is to create a web-based digital application to facilitate data collection
and management in a butterfly propagation facility. The target organism for this effort will be the island marble
butterfly. Each butterfly species has slightly different life cycles that are performed in facilities with different
features.Therefore, the needs of each program will vary slightly. Ideally the core application built for island marble
butterfly propagation data collection will develop code and concepts that can be modified to fit the needs of all butterfly
propagation programs.
